A simple Neural Machine Translation model using Transformer architecture to translate from English to Vietnamese

## Model architecture

This is using a simple Transformer Architecture with 6 encoder blocks, 6 decoder blocks. All of which uses Multi-head attention mechanism with 8 heads.

The model dimension is 512, position-wise feed forwarding dimension is 2048 and some dropout layers with the drop rate of 0.1.
